# Jordan and Haala's Phase 1 Final Project 

## Project Goals

- 1: HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API with interactions between the client and the API handled asynchronously.

- 2: Entire app running on a single page.

- 3: Utilize 3 unique event-listeners that enable interactivity.

- 4: Implement an instance of array iteration using available array methods 
    forEach


    ## 1 Public API

    With the concent of our instructor, we constructed a local JSON database, to which we sent our API requests. Data is parsed asynchronously into a function.  Javascript deployment is deferred. 

    ## 2 Single Page

    Call functionality exists soley on one page. Implemented additional functionality to follow social media links to external sites. (Project contains one HTML page.)

    ## 3/4 Three Unique Event Listners and Array Iteration 
        1. Dark mode toggle. Utilizes JavaScript and HTML to toggle CSS class to dark-mode.
        2. Clickable images. Utilize JavaScript to populate DOM elements with data in JSON server on click event. Allow detailed data and additional photos to display below carousel. This is also the first and second instance of array iteration with a forEach method to display each photo in the carousel AND a second forEach method to display the detailed photos contained in the JSON array like objects.
        3. Scroll functionality. Utilize JavaScript to scroll through photos in the carousel by clicking on "Scroll Left" and "Scroll Right" buttons. Manipulating position of DOM elements with buttons.
        4. Modal pop-up functionality. Utilize JavaScript and CSS to display a larger pop-up version of the image clicked on. 
        5. Submit function. Provide user ability to submit personal contact info and save data to an object (psudo-database-update).
        6. Social Media Links. Implements a redirect to external sites as result of clicking on corresponding logo. Additionally utilized CSS to change color of logos with mouse hover.
